\section{Cahn Hilliard}
We have shown the convergence and acuracy of these expoential integrators both analytically and computationally when applied to parabolic PDEs.
The above example of the wave equation shows that these methods have applications to a wider class of PDEs.
Considering this, we continue to widen our scope looking into the Cahn-Hilliard equations \cite{Kim2016}.

\subsection{Formulation of Problem}
The statement of the Cahn-Hilliard equations is as follows:
\begin{align*}
\phi_t &= \nabla
\end{align*}
