\headerbox{Motivation}
{name=motivation,column=0,row=0,span=2}
{
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solutions to PDEs are important across scientific disciplines 
\item One approach is to use exponential integrators
\item These methods can be computationally demanding as we need to calculate the matrix exponential $e^Av$ which can be expensive
\item Kyrlov subspace methods have recently gained traction for a way to compute the matrix exponential efficiently\cite{Moler2003}.
\end{itemize}
For a discretised PDE: $\dot u = N(u)$ with Forward Euler time-stepping we get: $u^{n+1} = u^n+\tau N(u^n)$ for $\tau < \tau_{FE}$ where $\tau_{FE}$ depends on the specific problem. Using exponential integrators we have $u^{n+1} = e^{DN(u^n)\tau}(u^n + \tau(N(u^n)-DN(u^n)))$ which, for some problems can work for $\tau >> \tau_{FE}$ reducing the number of steps necessary.

\headerbox{1) Algorithms}
{name=section_one,span=1,column=0,below=motivation}
{
We compare several algorithms for computing the matrix exponential:
\begin{itemize}
\item Arnoldi
\item Lanczos \cite{OJALVO1970}
\item Kiops \cite{Gaudreault2018}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\begin{algorithm}[H]

\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Arnoldi}{$A, \hat v_1,m$}
\State $v_0 \gets 0$
\For{$j = 1,2,...,m$}	
\For{$i = 1,2,...,j$}
\State$h_{ij} \gets v_i^T A v_i$
\EndFor
\State$\theta_j \gets Av_j - \sum^j_{i=1} h_{ij}v_i$
\State$h_{j+1,j} \gets ||\theta_j||$
\State$v_{j+1} \gets \theta_j/h_{j+1,j}$
\EndFor
\EndProcedure

\headerbox{2) Results for Parabolic Equation}
{name=section_two,span=1,column=0,below=section_one,above=bottom}
{
Bellow we compare results for a parabolic equation with the true solution given by:
\begin{align*}
\text{with exact solution }\hat u(t,x) &= cos(4\pi t)cos(2\pi x_0)
\end{align*}
We compare the error relative to the true solution with the number of calls to the operator:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.2\textheight]{FEMethodPlots/Operator Calls V Error for Parabolic Test2 with grid size 3600.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Comparision of Several Methods for a Parabolic Problem Note: The Arnoldi and Lanczos Methods performed identically}
    \label{fig:example_c}
\end{center}
From this and other results that have been omitted for brevity:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Kyrlov methods achieved a lower minimum bound
\item The difference between the Kyrlov methods and the Backwards Euler methods was more pronounced for larger grid sizes
\end{itemize}
}


\headerbox{3) Applications to Allen Cahn Equations}
{name=section_three,span=1,column=1,below=motivation}
{
Here we look at using these Kyrlov-based solvers to compute solutions for the Allen Cahn Equations:
\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
	    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=0.135\textheight]{FEPics/Allen Cahn Test2_60x60_0.025_Seed BE_EndTime=50.png}
	    \captionof{figure}{The Initial Condtion}
	    \label{fig:example}
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
	\begin{center}
		The Allen Cahn equations in weak form are given by:
		\begin{align*}
		\int_{\Omega} \partial_tu v dx &= a(u,v)\\
		&\text {where }\\
		a(u,v) &= \int_{\Omega} 10^{-4} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v\\
			  &+ (u^2-1)uv dx
		\end{align*}
	\end{center}
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
	    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=0.135\textheight]{FEPics/Allen Cahn Test2_60x60_0.025_EXPARN_EndTime=20.png}
	    \captionof{figure}{Allen Cahn Equation Solution Using the Arnoldi Algorithm at T=20}
	    \label{fig:example}    
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
	    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=0.135\textheight]{FEPics/Allen Cahn Test2_60x60_0.025_EXPARN_EndTime=50.png}
	    \captionof{figure}{Allen Cahn Equation Solution Using the Arnoldi Algorithm at T=50}
	    \label{fig:example}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
We observed that the different methods tested for the same initial conditions produced approximately the same results.

{
Conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Kyrlov methods appear to outperform the Backwards Euler Method
\item These methods also seem effective for providing solutions to the Allen Cahn Equation
\end{itemize}
