\section{Introduction}

Consider a PDE of the following form:

\begin{align*}
    \partial_t u = N(u)\\
\end{align*}

These PDEs of this from are common when looking into Phase boundary problems such as the Allen-Cahn equations. %maybe add a citation
While for some instances exact soltions to these PDEs exist and are known, in many practical cases however it is often neccessary to compute approximate solutions to these PDEs.
In order to achieve this, we will need to discretise in space yielding an ODE.
We do this via finite element methods giving:
\begin{align*}
    M\frac d{dt} u_h = N_h(u)\\
\end{align*}
For a mass matrix $M$ and some $N_h$.
From here we can apply methods that can solve this ODE in time.
